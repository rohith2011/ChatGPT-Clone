# ChatGPT Clone Website

Welcome to the ChatGPT Clone Website project! This project aims to create a simplified version of OpenAI's ChatGPT model for generating text-based conversations.

## Overview

The ChatGPT Clone Website is a web application that allows users to interact with a simplified version of the ChatGPT model. Users can input messages, and the model will respond with generated text based on its training data.

## Features

- User-friendly interface for interacting with the ChatGPT model
